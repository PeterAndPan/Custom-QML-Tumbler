# Custom-QML-Tumbler

# Notice

For now it only supports integer numbers. I'm planning to expand it to support any type of data.

# Usage

It's pretty easy to use. Just copy qml in your project and create component with that name.

# Properties

minValue // Sets minimum integer value

maxValue // Sets maximum integer vlaue

stepSize // By how much value is incrased in each step

value // Current value

width // Width of control

height // Height of control
